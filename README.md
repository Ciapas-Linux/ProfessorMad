# ProfessorMad : Adventures of Professor Łysolek

**ProfessorMad** The open source prototype of the game titled the Adventures of Professor Łysolek (eng: Ysolek) made using the godot the latest possible version 2D/3D game engine.
We learn and test new engine functionalities. We want the gameplay to be mixed depending on the level, sometimes 2D, sometimes 3D and 2.5D.

For prototyping , i downloaded some assets from itch.io and opengameart.org under free licenses and some i created myself in blender and gimp. I am slowly replacing assets with mine as much as I can. 

Inspiration and sample very small fragments come from free examples available on the web, documentation, as well as the state machine I used from examples, perhaps gdquest.

During his exciting adventures, the professor will perform missions, bravely face all obstacles, he will face a lot of secrets and many obstacles to overcome. There will be very strong bosses, rich global madmen who take away people's freedom and destroy the earth. Of course, all for the good of people and animals.
