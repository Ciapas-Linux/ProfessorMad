# ProfessorMad : Adventures of Professor Łysolek

**ProfessorMad** The open source prototype of the game titled the Adventures of Professor Łysolek (eng: Ysolek) made using the godot 2D/3D game engine.

For prototyping , i downloaded some assets from itch.io and opengameart.org under free licenses and some i created myself in blender and gimp. I am slowly replacing assets with mine as much as I can. 

Inspiration and sample very small fragments come from free examples available on the web, documentation, as well as the state machine I used from examples, perhaps gdquest.

During his exciting adventures, the professor will perform missions, bravely face all obstacles, he will face a lot of secrets and many obstacles to overcome. Of course, all for the good of people and animals.
